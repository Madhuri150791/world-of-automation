NETWORK AUTOMATION

When any organization setup their Network Infrastructure, it follows through following phases:
- Requirement : Identifying the needs and requirement of the users, applications and devices which requires communication.
- Design : Based on the identified requirements, Network Design is laid out to cater the requirements of the organisation.
- Implementation: Once the design gets finalised, Network Infrastructure is deployed based on the agreed design. This phase relies heavily on the automation usecases.
- Testing : After Network Infrastructure is in place, Testing is performed to validate if the Network is compatible with the requirements identified and design finalized.
- Operation: Post successful testing Network Infrastructure becomes operational and configuration is changed only for operational purposes.

In above mentioned phases, Implementation and Operation phases rely heavily on the manual efforts. Due to which it is prone to human error which can cause operational cost to the organization.
